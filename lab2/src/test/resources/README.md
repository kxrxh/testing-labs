# Test Resources

This directory contains data files used for parameterized tests.

## Files

- `cos_standard_angles.csv`: Contains test data for cosine function at standard angles. The file has two columns:
  - `angle`: The angle in radians
  - `expected`: The expected cosine value for the given angle

The angles include standard values like 0, π/6, π/4, π/3, π/2, π, 3π/2, and 2π, as well as additional test cases.
