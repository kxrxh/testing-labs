# Integration Testing Strategy for System Function

## Overview

This document outlines the integration testing strategy for the system function project. The system implements a piecewise function that combines trigonometric and logarithmic functions:

- For x ≤ 0: `(((((sec(x) * csc(x)) / cos(x)) - sec(x)) ^ 2) - sin(x))`
- For x > 0: `(((((log_2(x) + log_10(x)) ^ 2) - log_2(x)) - log_10(x)) - log_5(x))`

The domain of the function is ℝ \ ({0} ∪ {-kπ/2}\_{k=1}^{∞}), meaning the function is undefined at x = 0 and x = -π/2, -π, -3π/2, ...

## Component Dependencies

The system follows this dependency structure:

```
graph TD
    A[System Function] --> B[Trigonometric Functions]
    A --> C[Logarithmic Functions]
    B --> D[cos x]
    B --> E[sin x]
    D --> E
    C --> F[ln x]
```

Specifically:

1. The system function depends on both domain-specific functions (negative and positive domain)
2. The negative domain function depends on trigonometric functions (sin, cos, sec, csc)
3. The positive domain function depends on logarithmic functions (log2, log10, log5)
4. Derived trigonometric functions depend on sin (cos depends on sin, sec depends on cos, csc depends on sin)
5. Derived logarithmic functions depend on ln

## Integration Testing Approach: Bottom-Up

We use a bottom-up integration approach, which starts with the lowest-level components and gradually integrates higher-level components until the complete system is tested. This approach ensures that basic building blocks are validated before testing more complex functionality.

### Integration Phases

#### Phase 1: Base Function Integration

- Test sin(x) and ln(x) base functions (should already be thoroughly unit tested)
- Verify their correct implementation using series expansion

#### Phase 2: Trigonometric Derivatives Integration

- Integrate cos(x) with sin(x)
- Integrate sec(x) with cos(x)
- Integrate csc(x) with sin(x)
- Verify trigonometric identity relationships

#### Phase 3: Logarithmic Derivatives Integration

- Integrate log2, log10, log5 with ln function
- Verify logarithm change of base formulas and properties

#### Phase 4: Domain-Specific Functions Integration

- Integrate NegativeDomainFunction with trigonometric functions
- Integrate PositiveDomainFunction with logarithmic functions
- Verify correct calculation of complex expressions

#### Phase 5: System Function Integration

- Integrate SystemFunction with NegativeDomainFunction and PositiveDomainFunction
- Verify correct domain delegation and boundary handling
- Test full system calculation for representative values

#### Phase 6: Mixed Integration (Partial Integration)

- Test with real implementations for some components and stubs for others
- Verify interoperability of real and stub implementations

## Testing with Stubs

For each integration phase, we can use stubs to isolate specific components:

1. Test with all stubs (baseline behavior)
2. Replace one component with its real implementation and test
3. Gradually replace more components until the entire system uses real implementations

This approach helps identify which component causes issues when integration tests fail.

## Test Data Selection Strategy

Test data is selected based on:

1. **Domain Analysis**: Testing values within each part of the piecewise function's domain
2. **Boundary Testing**: Values close to domain boundaries and singularities (0, -π/2, etc.)
3. **Representative Values**: Select values for which results can be pre-calculated for verification
4. **Edge Cases**: Very small values, very large values, etc.

## Expected Outcomes

1. Each integration phase should pass before proceeding to the next
2. Specific test values should match pre-calculated expected results within epsilon
3. Domain restrictions should be properly enforced
4. The system function should correctly delegate to appropriate domain-specific functions

## CSV Output Verification

Part of the testing involves verifying the CSV output functionality:

- Values should be correctly written to CSV files
- File format should meet specified requirements
- The step between x values should be configurable
